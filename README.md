# Notes on Deep Learning

## from the Author

These are the notes that I left working through Nielson's [neural Net and Deep Learning book](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com). You can find a table of contents of this repo below.

## Table of Contents

- [001 - sigmoid function](001%20-%20sigmoid%20function.ipynb)
- [002 - training a single perceptron](002%20-%20training%20a%20single%20perceptron.ipynb)
- [003 - use perceptrons to target arbitrary function](003%20-%20use%20perceptrons%20to%20target%20arbitrary%20function.ipynb)
- [004 - optimize batch training](004%20-%20optimize%20batch%20training.ipynb)

## Fun Highlights

some of the figures can be found scattered in the folder (I believe in a flat folder 
structure). Like this one below, it shows how a simple network can be trained 
to emulate a given target function.

## Todos:

- [ ] work on optimize batch training.
